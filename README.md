# _Spice Route Kitchen_
This is a full-stack web application for a restaurant that allows users to browse menu items, place orders, and view their order history. The application is built with modern technologies such as **_React_**, **_Material UI_**, **_Firebase_**, **_Nestjs_**, and **_MongoDB_**.

## Motivation
The main goal of this project was to showcase my skills in building scalable and maintainable applications using best practices. Additionally, I wanted to learn how to use Firebase Storage for hosting images and Material UI for styling.

## Features
* Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
* Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens
* Image upload and storage using Firebase Storage
* Redux Toolkit for state management
* Data persistence and CRUD operations using Mongoosejs
* RESTful API using NestJS framework


## Login Credentials

### Admin Account
**Email:** ```admin@test.com```<br />
**Password:** ```123456```

### User Account
